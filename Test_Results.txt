Document: Test_Resulst.txt

Purpose: This document will serve and and parameter outline for the 
application files:

*account-admin.py
*userAdmin.sh

This will ensure that the application will meet all the needed outlined in 
the project requirements. Below are the outlined targets for each part of the application, and 
the results of these test will be contained in the file Test_Results.txt

1. Testing account-admin.py

Test parameters:

a. Does the application report users that don't have password?

Pre-Conditions:

                  User Account Report
==========================================================================

Total User Accounts: 1

Account Locked: 0

Accounts without Expiration Dates: 0

Expired Accounts: 0

Changes:
Added 1 User account:

dlewellyn@ubuntu:~$ sudo useradd lewellyn -c 'My Test Account'

Verify:

~# grep -w lewellyn /etc/passwd && grep -w lewellyn /etc/shadow
lewellyn:x:1001:1001:My Test Account:/home/lewellyn:/bin/sh
lewellyn:!:17947:0:99999:7:::

As we can see the account is already locked.

The account has database entries yet has no password or expiration date.

Expired Accounts: 0

Results: Success

If the used account does not have a password or expiration date it will lock 
the account and report it.
	
b. Does the application report all expired account?

To verify this we will created a user account that has a password but no expiration date: 

~# useradd -c 'Another Test Account' -p ucantseeme joncena
~# grep -w joncena /etc/shadow && grep -w joncena /etc/passwd
joncena:ucantseeme:17947:0:99999:7:::
joncena:x:1002:1002:Another Test Account:/home/joncena:/bin/sh

Success. Ass you can see the application identified and expired account and 
locked it. Verified.

grep -w joncena /etc/shadow && grep -w joncena /etc/passwd
joncena:!ucantseeme:17947:0:99999:7:::
joncena:x:1002:1002:Another Test Account:/home/joncena:/bin/sh


c. Does the application report the expiration date/time for all accounts?

To test this I will create an account that has a password and expiration date

~# useradd -c 'The Nature Boy' -p woooooooooo -e 2020-10-31 rickflair

grep -w rickflair /etc/shadow && grep -w rickflair /etc/passwd
rickflair:woooooooooo:17947:0:99999:7::18566:
rickflair:x:1003:1003:The Nature Boy:/home/rickflair:/bin/sh

Expiration date is set for a Epoch of 18566

Results:

The time calcualtions isn't quite perfect but its CE.

We don't touch that system level accouts. Only report

Qualified Success.


2. Testing userAdmin.sh

Test parameters:

a. Does the application allow you to lock and unlock a user account?

For this section I will be using the same accounts as above. This makes for less cruft to sort through

Since we know the account 'rickflair' is unlocked we will user that in the demonstration.

Pre Conditions:

ubuntu:~# grep -w rickflair /etc/shadow && grep -w rickflair /etc/passwd
rickflair:woooooooooo:17947:0:99999:7::18566:
rickflair:x:1003:1003:The Nature Boy:/home/rickflair:/bin/sh

@ubuntu:~$ sudo ./userAdmin.sh 
Welcome: root
Please select from the following:
(1) Add User
(2) Modify Existing User
(3) Delete User
(4) Quit
2
Please enter Username[Enter]: rickflair
What would like to do?:
(1)Generate a New Password
(2)Set Expiration Date
(3)Unlock
(4)Lock
(5)Main
4
Locking account: rickflair

Post Condition:

~# grep -w rickflair /etc/shadow && grep -w rickflair /etc/passwd
rickflair:!woooooooooo:17947:0:99999:7::18566:
rickflair:x:1003:1003:The Nature Boy:/home/rickflair:/bin/sh

As you can see the account is now locked. Now we will unlock the same Account.

Please select from the following:
(1) Add User
(2) Modify Existing User
(3) Delete User
(4) Quit
2
Please enter Username[Enter]: rickflair
What would like to do?:
(1)Generate a New Password
(2)Set Expiration Date
(3)Unlock
(4)Lock
(5)Main
3
Unlocking account: rickflair

Post Condition:

~# grep -w rickflair /etc/shadow && grep -w rickflair /etc/passwd
rickflair:woooooooooo:17947:0:99999:7::18566:
rickflair:x:1003:1003:The Nature Boy:/home/rickflair:/bin/sh

He is now unlocked.

b. Does the application allow you to change the Expiration Date on an account?

For this test the account 'joncena' will be used since it is reported as locked
with no exiration date.

Pre - Conditions:

joncena:!ucantseeme:17947:0:99999:7:::
joncena:x:1002:1002:Another Test Account:/home/joncena:/bin/sh

Please enter Username[Enter]: joncena
What would like to do?:
(1)Generate a New Password
(2)Set Expiration Date
(3)Unlock
(4)Lock
(5)Main
2
Set a new expiration date for joncena
Enter YYYY: 
2020
Enter MM: 
12
Enter DD: 
01
Welcome: root
Please select from the following:
(1) Add User
(2) Modify Existing User
(3) Delete User
(4) Quit
2
Please enter Username[Enter]: joncena
What would like to do?:
(1)Generate a New Password
(2)Set Expiration Date
(3)Unlock
(4)Lock
(5)Main
3
Unlocking account: joncena

Post Conditions:

~# grep -w joncena /etc/shadow && grep -w joncena /etc/passwd
joncena:ucantseeme:17947:0:99999:7::18597:
joncena:x:1002:1002:Another Test Account:/home/joncena:/bin/sh

As you can see 'joncena' is now unlocked and has a Epoch time set to: 18597

c. Does the application allow you add a user to the system?

Pre-conditions: Since we have only added 3 account they will be at the end of the /etc/passwd file:

tail -n 4 /etc/passwd
dlewellyn:x:1000:1000:DAVID LEWELLYN,,,:/home/dlewellyn:/bin/bash
lewellyn:x:1001:1001:My Test Account:/home/lewellyn:/bin/sh

rickflair:x:1003:1003:The Nature Boy:/home/rickflair:/bin/sh

sudo ./userAdmin.sh 
Welcome: root
Please select from the following:
(1) Add User
(2) Modify Existing User

Number of days of warning before password expires       : 7

Password: MmNhYjNmMT
The account is currently locked:
Pending user login
 
Post Condition:

~# grep -w brother /etc/shadow && grep -w brother /etc/passwd
brother:!MmNhYjNmMT:17947:0:99999:7:::
brother:x:1004:1004:Hulk Hogan:/wwe/brother:/bin/sh

Since the account is locked by default we simply have to use the unlock feature
when the user logs in and this is where they will set thier password.

*Extra functionality outside Scope of Work

d. Does the application allow you to remove a user account?
