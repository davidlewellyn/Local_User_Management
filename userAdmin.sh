# Script: userAdmin.sh
# Author: David Lewellyn
#
# Purpose: The purpose of this script is to 
# accomidate the account-admin.py. While the 
# account-admin.py file is meant to run in a cron tab
# this script is designed to be invoked by the admin
# to correct or create user accounts. This script is in 
# BASH because i didn't find a concrete python module to 
# handle *nix user management. I could have used a wrapper
# script but that would have been more trouble than its worth
#
# Deliverabled:
# - Create a User
# - Specify:
#   - username
#   - home directory
#   - full name
#   - Allow user to set password upon login
#   - Account expiration date
#   - Do not allow root to have an expiration set
#
# Testing Criteria will include the ability to create
# a local user. Modify and existing user. Unlock as exitsing 
# users account, and finally attempt to modify root with this application
